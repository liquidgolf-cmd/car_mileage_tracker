# Using the App Without Location Tracking (Workaround)

## ✅ Good News

Even if location tracking isn't working due to the CoreLocation error, **you can still use the app**! The app supports manual entry of addresses and distances.

## 🚀 How to Use Manual Entry

### Option 1: Start Trip, Enter Addresses Later

1. **Start a Trip** (tracks time only):
   - Click "Start Trip" button
   - The trip will track time even without location
   - Distance will show 0.00 miles (that's okay!)

2. **End the Trip**:
   - Click "End Trip" when done
   - Select category and save trip

3. **Edit Trip to Add Addresses**:
   - Go to "Trips" tab
   - Click on the trip you just saved
   - Click "Edit Trip" button
   - Enter "Starting Address" (e.g., "123 Main St, City, State")
   - Enter "Destination Address" (e.g., "456 Oak Ave, City, State")
   - Click "Calculate Distance" button
   - The app will automatically calculate distance from the addresses
   - Click "Save" to update the trip

### Option 2: Enter Everything Manually

1. **Start Trip**:
   - Click "Start Trip" (tracks time)

2. **End Trip**:
   - Click "End Trip"
   - Select category and save

3. **Edit Trip**:
   - Go to Trips → Click trip → Edit Trip
   - Enter addresses manually
   - OR enter distance directly in "Distance" field
   - The app will calculate deduction automatically

### Option 3: Use Trip Detail View

The trip detail view has full editing capabilities:

- **Edit start/end addresses** - Type full addresses
- **Calculate distance** - Click button to calculate from addresses
- **Enter distance directly** - Type distance if you know it
- **Edit dates/times** - Adjust when trip occurred
- **Edit category/notes** - Change any details

## 📝 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Drive from Office to Client

1. **At Office**:
   - Open app, click "Start Trip"
   - App tracks time (location may not work, that's okay)

2. **Drive to Client**:
   - App continues tracking time
   - Distance stays at 0.00 (normal if location not working)

3. **Arrive at Client**:
   - Click "End Trip"
   - Select "Business" category
   - Select or add client business
   - Click "Save Trip"

4. **Later, Edit Trip**:
   - Go to Trips tab
   - Click on the trip
   - Click "Edit Trip"
   - Starting Address: "123 Business St, City, State"
   - Destination Address: "456 Client Ave, City, State"
   - Click "Calculate Distance" → App calculates automatically
   - Click "Save"

✅ **Trip is now complete with correct distance!**

## 🎯 Benefits of Manual Entry

- ✅ Works even when location services fail
- ✅ More accurate addresses (GPS can be off)
- ✅ You control the data
- ✅ Distance calculation from addresses is very accurate

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save addresses you use often**:
   - Once you enter an address, it's saved in the trip
   - You can copy/paste addresses from previous trips

2. **Use Google Maps to find addresses**:
   - Open Google Maps
   - Find your location
   - Copy the full address
   - Paste into the app

3. **Distance calculation is accurate**:
   - The app uses Google's geocoding
   - Calculates distance using the same method as GPS
   - Often more accurate than GPS due to GPS drift

## 🔄 When Location Starts Working

Once you fix the system location issue:
- New trips will automatically track location
- Old manually-entered trips stay as-is (no need to change them)
- You can still manually edit any trip anytime

## ✅ Bottom Line

**You don't need location tracking to use the app!** Manual entry works great and is sometimes more accurate. Use this workaround while troubleshooting the system location issue.
