# Where to Find GitHub Repository URL in Vercel

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Your Project
1. Open Vercel Dashboard (vercel.com)
2. Click on your project (should be named something like "car-mileage")

### Step 2: Open Settings
1. Click the **"Settings"** tab at the top
2. Look at the **LEFT SIDEBAR** menu

### Step 3: Click on "Git"
1. In the left sidebar, find and click **"Git"**
2. This will show the Git integration settings

### Step 4: Find Repository Section
On the Git settings page, you'll see:

**"Repository"** section which shows:
- GitHub icon/logo
- Repository name (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME/car-mileage-tracker`)
- Or a URL like: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME`

**This is the repository URL you need!**

## What to Look For

You should see something like:
- Repository: `github.com/mike-hills-projects/car-mileage-tracker`
- Or: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/car-mileage-tracker`

---

## If You Don't See Git Section

If there's no "Git" option in Settings:
1. The project might not be connected to GitHub yet
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository during import

## Once You Have the URL

Copy the repository URL and I can help you push your code to it!

The URL format will be:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git`
- Or just: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME`
